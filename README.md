## Acknowledgment

Inspired on [Zara Patterson Google Map from 2010](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/viewer?mid=1l2VAhplHwkWYhNi6WOcDeqnxPoE&ll=41.38994767203882%2C2.1714785646320367&z=13&fbclid=IwAR0Nz0oQug6qn9cU2yfmNpWFeOKMcscwQf2-Gp2Oiks0WavhvUgzlui5_FE) and her website https://caerengracia.wordpress.com/, in which she ["lists resources to carry on restoration and renovation works ecologically"](https://caerengracia.wordpress.com/eco-recursos/).

## Intro

"Where and when can I salvage old, abandoned, furniture in Barcelona?" is a question that me, my friends, friends of friends, and coworkers have asked from time to time.

Unfortunately, the 2010 map made by Zara was last updated in 2016. 
It is a miracle by itself that the map stil exists, and has survived in a service of Google that hasn't been discontinued. [Unlike many other Google services.](https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/26/20977968/google-graveyard-products-shut-down-dead-not-supported-discontinues-spring-cleaning/archives/3)

The town hall (Ajuntament/Municipality) only provides information [for each street individually](https://ajuntament.barcelona.cat/cercador-de-residus/ca)
The other alternative are maps for each district individually[(1)](https://ajuntament.barcelona.cat/horta-guinardo/es/noticia/muebles-y-trastos-viejos-el-dia-que-toca-3_1345274),[(2)](https://ajuntament.barcelona.cat/lescorts/es/noticia/mobles-i-trastos-vells-el-dia-que-toca-2_1346730),[(3)](https://ajuntament.barcelona.cat/gracia/ca/noticia/muebles-y-trastos-viejos-el-dia-que-toca-2_1345185). Some of these even have different presentations [(4)](https://ajuntament.barcelona.cat/gracia/ca/noticia/muebles-y-trastos-viejos-el-dia-que-toca-2_1345185).

Since I couldn't find a complete map of trash (furniture) collection for Barcelona I have compiled the data from the Ajuntament website and made my own maps.

They are now yours. Happy hunting.

## Maps

The raw data can be found in this repository. I might document this, eventually.
